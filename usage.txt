## for usage of this folder; codebase

This is a work-in-progress area for building a ton of automation
code for finance, accounting, and all things related. 

eventually, this will be merged with the calendar/ logistics project
built for Mobile TV Group and Calmechanic.com.   

presently; (as of 12-20-2022) I have some highly effective automation
useful for scraping and parsing portalMobiletvgroup API to make 
invoice line items for EIC jobs, overtime, travel days and per-diem. 
there is also a good setup for parsing receipt data, then matching to 
jobs from portal. 

Using verify.com API, I found this is the most effective, due to the 
parsing outout structure of the data parsed from a variety of PDF or 
PNG image files.

By omitting the steps (custom built) to parse lyft ride reports, this 
data is different. It is already structured as it outputs a .csv file
with fields needed already. Plus, the tool written to match rides to 
their specific job dates based on ride notes (IE to airport, to hotel,
venue, etc. ) is a different challenge than what receipt information 
provides.
